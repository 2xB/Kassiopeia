# total number of rectangles described by this file

2

# the following 16 parameters are described as follows:
# 1: The index is the number of the rectangle in the file. It starts
#    at 1 for the first rectangle, and increments by one for each
#    subsequent rectangle.
# 2: This parameter indicates to which KTElectrodeGroup the rectangle
#    belongs. Rectangles that are in the same group must be placed
#    together in the file, and the group parameter must start at one and
#    increment by only one (for rectangles within the same group, it does
#    not increment at all). Alternatively, the group parameter can be set
#    to -1 for all of the rectangles, indicating that the rectangles are
#    not grouped.
# 3: This parameter is not used by the card reader.
# 4: For repeated rectangles about the azimuthal axis, this parameter
#    sets the number of repeated instances of the rectangle the program
#    should create. The # of replicas must be greater than or equal to
#    one; if a rectangle is not repeated about the azimuthal axis, the
#    parameter should be set to one.
# 5,6,7: The x, y, and z-coordinates of a corner of the rectangle (m)
# 8,9,10: the unit vector pointing from P0 along the longer side of
#         the rectangle (side A)
# 11,12,13: the unit vector pointing from P0 along the shorter side of
#           the rectangle (side B)
# 14: the magnitude of the longer side (A) of the rectangle (m)
# 15: the magnitude of the shorter side (B) of the rectangle (m)
# 16: the potential of the electrode (V)
