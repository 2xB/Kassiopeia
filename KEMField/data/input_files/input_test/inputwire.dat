# total number of wires described by this file

1

# the following 16 parameters are described as follows:
# 1: The index is the number of the wire in the file. It starts at 1
#    for the first wire, and increments by one for each subsequent
#    wire.
# 2: This parameter indicates to which KTElectrodeGroup the wire
#    belongs. Wires that are in the same group must be placed together in
#    the file, and the group parameter must start at one and increment by
#    only one (for wires within the same group, it does not increment at
#    all). Alternatively, the group parameter can be set to -1 for all of
#    the wires, indicating that the wires are not grouped.
# 3: This parameter is not used by the card reader.
# 4: For repeated wires about the azimuthal axis, this parameter sets
#    the number of repeated instances of the wire the program should
#    create. The # of replicas must be greater than or equal to one; if a
#    wire is not repeated about the azimuthal axis, the parameter should
#    be set to one.
# 5,6,7: These three parameters describe the x, y, and z-coordinates
#        of one end of the wire (m).
# 8,9,10: These three parameters describe the x, y, and z-coordinates of
#         the other end of the wire (m).
# 11: Describes the diameter of the wire (m).
# 12,13,14,15: These parameters are not used by the card reader.
# 16: Describes the potential of the electrode (V).
