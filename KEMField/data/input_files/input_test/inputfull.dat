# total number of conic sections described by the file

2

# the following 6 parameters are described as follows:
#     1: z-coordinate of the 1st endpoint of the generating line (m)
#     2: r-coordinate of the 1st endpoint of the generating line (m)
#     3: z-coordinate of the 2nd endpoint of the generating line (m)
#     4: r-coordinate of the 2nd endpoint of the generating line (m)
#     5: Potential at which the electrode is held (V)
#     6: the number of conic sections into which the conic section
#        will be discretized (0 if no discretization)

1.5	1	3	1	50	10

# the next 6 parameters are identical in meaning to the previous line,
# for the second conic section
